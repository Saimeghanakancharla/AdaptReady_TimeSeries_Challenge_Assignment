# AdaptReady_TimeSeries_Challenge_Assignment

Preprocessed the Datasets
Resample the train dataset of 15 min interval to 1 hour interval
Used sliding window to transform the problem of time series forecasting into a supervised learning problem
Compiled and fitted all three neural network models
predicted oit temperature values
